# ZeroptodaltidoTeam's Platformer
You are a Gorila that can throw bananas at your enemies and restore health out of sheer determination. Your goal is to reach the light beam in order to save the jungle and become a hero! Make your path across the jungle by jumping on mushrooms and defeating any birds that dare to interpose in your way. Jump from platform to platform with your tree-jumping abilities and avoid falling into the most darkest, deepest parts of the jungle. Don't sleep! It is your destiny to save the jungle!
